I was both Head Design Responsible for <b>combat</b> (which meant spearheading the boss designs, enemies, new weapons) as well as being responsible for <b>onboarding and first time user experience</b>, which meant designing the tutorial and new feature introductions. This was extra important in TM as one of the main problems with the game throughout it's history was the large amount of players dropping the game early on because of it's complexity.

*"When I was a kid I believed being a game developer meant scratching game discs by hand all day. And this still didn't stop me wanting to become one.
My understanding of making games has changed a lot since then, but my passion stays the same."*

On my free time you can find me on the wakeboard, playing table tennis, studying psychology, learning a new instrument, and playing lots and lots of games.
