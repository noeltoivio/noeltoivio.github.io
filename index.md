Greetings!

My name is Noel Toivio and when I was a kid I believed being a game developer meant scratching game discs by hand all day. And I still wanted to become one.
My idea of making games has changed a lot since then, but my passion stays the same.

I specialize in Game Design, but love all parts of development. Games are made together after all!
