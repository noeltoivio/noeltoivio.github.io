*"When I was a kid I believed being a game developer meant scratching game discs by hand all day. And this still didn't stop me wanting to become one.
My understanding of making games has changed a lot since then, but my passion stays the same."*

On my free time I enjoy wakeboard, table tennis, studying psychology, learning new instruments and of course playing lots and lots of games.
