*"When I was a kid I believed being a game developer meant scratching game discs by hand all day. And this still didn't stop me wanting to become one.
My understanding of making games has changed a lot since then, but my passion stays the same."*

On my free time you can find me on the wakeboard, playing table tennis, studying psychology, learning a new instrument, and playing lots and lots of games. Of course, all at the same time üòé
