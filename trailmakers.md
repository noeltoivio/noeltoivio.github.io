# Trailmakers 2.0 - Pioneers

An example of some patch notes I wrote for a Trailmakers balance patch.

> <b>Shotgun</b> <br>
> <i>When we released pioneers we wanted the shotgun to be the main weapon for a new user as the flow of combat was interesting but not too difficult. It was more about timing than aiming, and we wanted the weapon to be generous. But it was overtuned in terms of damage, making the other weapons less viable. Rather than experimenting with other weapons as you progress, it was just so much better sticking with your guns (badum tss). With this change we hope that the Shotguns will keep it's ideal use case, while allowing other weapons to not get overshadowed.</i>

> <i>This was simply over tuned, and the community let us know. (Thanks for that!) Though the weapon is trickier to hit with, just getting one okay shot in would end the fight instantly which is not too fun. The idea was always for the grenade launcher to reward timing and positioning and feeling satisfying when getting a good hit, but it was simply too strong. As a quick fix before the release of Pioneers the reload delay was extended to balance out it's power. But in the end the long reload time felt so awkward, almost enough to forget about it being there between shots. With a slightly shorter reload time and less power we hope for it to be more of an in-and-out weapon with a more comfortable engage/disengage cycle. </i>
