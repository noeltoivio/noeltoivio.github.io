> As this project is still in development I will add more content as the game grows.

## My goals with this project

- Stepping out of my comfort zone and learn about all parts of development like modelling, rigging, animating, narrative, localization, release process etc.
- Explore low-scope developmentâ€”can I make it fun <i>and</i> cheap?
- Deep-dive and discover the relationship between two of my main interests, games and psychology

More info to come as I'm still working on this, so stay tuned ðŸ“º
